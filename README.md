#Swordfish 2020
######Swordfish formal applicant test.

##Preface
Greetings; thank you for your time to asses this assignment.

Best regards,
Allie.

### Premise
- Challenge: small web application that uses the Github API and OAuth to view a list of issues and create new issues.
- Two tasks are specified: 
    - Task 1: List issues
    - Task 2: Write issues
- **Important Information**.
    - OAuth to authenticate your web application.
    - Email iwant2work@swordfish.co.za providing us with the
        - IP Address or domain name, 
        - your OAuth callback URL and your 
        - Github Username
    

###Objectives
- Integrate with Github API v3 via OAuth.
- Create class definitions to represent the Github entities.
    - Write class interface.
    - Implement class methods.
- Build web interface.

###Focus
- Simplicity and readability of code.
- Exception mitigation.
- Ease of use.
- Verbosity of code comments.
 
####Predicates
- Public domain to be used: allie.co.za
- No state/database necessary.
- PHP 7.3+
- Vanilla code style; illustrating ability to un-cook spaghetti.
- Personal Github account: AllieTheDemonHunter
- No guide or manual falls in the scope.
- No writing of extensive repository commit messages.
- Unit/Functional testing excepted. 

####Exception Handling
- Indicated as imperative this assignment.
    - Semantic user messages upon fatal errors. (Nice to have)
    - Limit to sufficient catch clauses, as not to overcrowd the app.

####Ui/Ux
- Allocating a maximum percentage of time to 25% for styling.
- No frontend layout framework except, an html boilerplate stylesheet and jQuery.
- Mobile/responsiveness not imperative, but a mobile first approach to be held to.
